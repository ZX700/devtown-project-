# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project applies **Machine Learning models** to the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset** to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.  
It covers **data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation** with multiple ML algorithms.
## 📌 Project Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction using patient health records can assist in better treatment and prevention.  
In this project, i:
- Preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, encode categorical features, scale data).
- Train machine learning models such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Evaluate models with metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC
- Visualize results (Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve).
## 📂 Dataset
i use the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset** which contains patient health features such as:
- Age, Sex, Chest Pain type (cp), Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps), Cholesterol (chol),  
- Maximum Heart Rate (thalach), Exercise Induced Angina (exang), ST Depression (oldpeak),  
- And others.
The **target variable**:
- `1` → Patient has heart disease  
- `0` → Patient does not have heart disease  
📊 Results
Logistic Regression → Good baseline performance
Decision Tree → Easy to interpret, slightly lower generalization
Random Forest → Best performance overall with balanced accuracy and recall
📌 Evaluation metrics and plots are included in the notebook.
